# developer-portal-ideas
Ideas on how the software developer guidelines and catalogue of repos might look.

Visit https://coretl.github.io/developer-portal-ideas to see built docs.

## Building locally

To build the docs locally run:

```shell
$ ./make.sh
```

This will make a venv and pop-up a web browser pointing to a locally hosted version of the docs, auto-rebuilding and refreshing when you make changes to the source
